### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dane Henson!

I'm a **problem-solver** with a passion for building, breaking, and rebuilding to truly understand how things work. My philosophy is simple: if I don't know it, I'll learn itâ€”and I'll probably enjoy the process of diving deep into new tech along the way.

Currently, I'm sharpening my skills and eager to apply my adaptable mindset to new challenges.

**What I'm passionate about:**
* **Rapid Prototyping & Iteration:** Getting working solutions out fast, then refining them.
* **Learning New Technologies:** Whether it's a new language, framework, or paradigm, I'm always ready to jump in. I thrive on expanding my toolkit and embracing innovative approaches.
* **Clean, Efficient Code:** Writing maintainable code that gets the job done.
* **Solving Real-World Problems:** Turning complex challenges into elegant solutions.
